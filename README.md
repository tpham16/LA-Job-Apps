## Introduction
The LA County Job Applications Data Analysis project aims to evaluate job application data across multiple roles in LA County for the 2013-2015 fiscal years. The goal is to support potential policy changes at the city and state levels. The dashboard includes analyses of top-performing industries, average salaries, and gender and ethnicity demographics.
